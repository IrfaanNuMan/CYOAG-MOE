			 <p> 'Excuse me,' said the little pig politely. 'Would you please sell some of your sticks so I can make a house?'

					The man readily agreed and the little pig went off to find a good place to build his house. In no time the little pig
					had built his stick house and set off to play.<br>
					One starlit night, soon after he had settled in, he heard a screaming and banging at his door. When he peeped through his door he saw his brother screaming frantically.
					He quickly let his brother in after which he told him how the wolf had blew his straw house down and was trying to eat him. The second pig assured his brother that his 
					stick house was stronger than his straw house and the wolf would never get them there.
					
					The next night the wolf came out looking for food. By the light of the moon he espied the little pig’s house of stick and he sidled up to the door and called:<br>

					'Little pig, little pig, let me come in.'<br>

					'No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin!' replied the little pigs.<br>

'					'Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in!' said the wolf.<br>
				 And he huffed, and he puffed and he blew the house in. But the little pigs ran away as fast as their trotters could carry them. They were so frightened they didn't know where to run.
				 The first little pig said lets run to our brother, The second little pig said no lets run to our mother.
